# Recipe Box created using React.js

## About

Technology used:

- React

- Redux

Functionality will enable the following user stories:

- I can create recipes that have names and ingredients.

- I can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible.

- I can click into any of those recipes to view it.

- I can edit these recipes.

- I can delete these recipes.

Inspiration for the app comes from Free Code Camp - more info [here](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-recipe-box)
